# 🌏📗 GIS-Drone-and-Machine-Learning-for-Resource-Mapping-QGIS-Week-5 🗾
# 🇮🇳 QGIS India's Geospatial Data Project

# 🌍 Project Overview
In Week 5, we explored the use of Google Earth Pro as a practical and accessible tool for remote sensing and resource mapping. This week was all about understanding how to perform real-world spatial analysis using satellite imagery and manual geotagging techniques.

To demonstrate this, we used our own institution, MCKV Institute of Engineering, Liluah, Howrah, West Bengal, as a case study to identify and map various campus features.

# 🎯 Objective
- To learn how to use Google Earth Pro for identifying and tagging real-world resources.
- To understand the use of polygons for area selection and placemarks for geo-tagging.
- To practically apply these tools by mapping the MCKVIE campus.
- To visualize and store longitude and latitude data for different campus landmarks.
- To build the foundation for manual ground truthing before integrating drone or ML-based analysis.

# ✨ Key Features
- Use of Google Earth Pro for manual remote sensing.
- Marking and mapping a specific area using the Polygon tool.
- Geotagging important landmarks using Placemarks.
- Live capture of longitude and latitude coordinates.
- Hands-on mapping of real-life resources within a known area.

🛠️ Project Steps
1. Open Google Earth Pro and navigate to your area of interest.
2. In the Places panel, right-click on My Places → select Add → then Folder.
  - Rename the folder to “MCKV Campus”.
3. Right-click the new folder → select Add Polygon → rename to “MCKV Campus Area”.
  - Under Properties, use the mouse to draw the campus boundary by clicking around its perimeter.
  - Save and close.
4. Now, inside the same folder, you can Add Placemarks for key landmarks:
  - Click Add Placemark
  - Move the icon to the desired location (e.g., Bus Stand, Mango Tree, Gate-3, etc.)
  - Rename each placemark appropriately
  - Longitude & Latitude coordinates are automatically stored
5. Save the folder or export the map as .KML or .KMZ file for future integration with GIS tools like QGIS.

📍 Example Placemarks Added:
  - 📌MCKV_Bus
  -📌 MCKV Mango Tree
  - 📌MCKV Gate-3
  - 📌Each of these is geo-tagged and can be used later in drone mapping or to verify data accuracy during model training.

# 📝 Requirements
- ⬇️ Install Google Earth Pro (Free): https://www.google.com/intl/en_in/earth/about/versions/#download-pro
- Basic internet connection
- A real-world location to map (e.g., your school, campus, or neighborhood)

# ✅ Benefits of This Analysis
- Easy real-world application of geospatial mapping tools.
- Helps in pre-survey planning before drone flights.
- Geo-tagging acts as manual ground truthing for machine learning models.
- Visualizes resource locations in a real-time, interactive environment.
- Files can be easily exported to GIS platforms like QGIS for further analysis.
