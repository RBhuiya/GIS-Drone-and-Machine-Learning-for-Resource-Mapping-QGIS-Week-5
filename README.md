# 🇮🇳 QGIS India's Geospatial Data Project

# 🌍 Project Overview
In Week 5, we explored the use of Google Earth Pro as a practical and accessible tool for remote sensing and resource mapping. This week was all about understanding how to perform real-world spatial analysis using satellite imagery and manual geotagging techniques.
To demonstrate this, we used our own institution, MCKV Institute of Engineering, Liluah, Howrah, West Bengal, as a case study to identify and map various campus features.
